The river is a vital source of water for the 10 million people who live there, but years of neglect have dramatically reduced the quality of the water. As part of the new partnership, Oris will be supporting a series of clean-up days Seoul KFEM has scheduled. During these, hundreds of local volunteers will work along the river to pick up litter, plastic and other harmful pollutants. The events will also help raise awareness of the importance of clean water in Seoul.",
