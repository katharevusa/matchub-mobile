As part of the new partnership, Oris will be supporting a series of clean-up days Seoul KFEM has scheduled.

What do you do with the items which do not spark joy? Discard them? Often, this scenario is common in Singapore. However, do you know that discarding is not the only way to get rid of these pre-loved clothes? You can give them a new lease of life by recycling! Let's get started!",

Surely, some of us must have attempted the KonMarie’s method to start our journey on decluttering our jam-packed closet. The meaning of decluttering is to get rid of clothes that do not spark joy out. Thanks to KonMarie,  your closet’s now organised, clean, and left with the items you need. What’s next? What do you do with the items which do not spark joy? Discard them? Often, this scenario is common in Singapore. However, do you know that discarding is not the only way to get rid of these pre-loved clothes? You can give them a new lease of life by recycling! Let's get started!",
